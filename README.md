ECS-Dashbaord
======================
This project provides Custom Kibana Dashboards for EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS).

# Description

This project is divided in three sub systems:

1. ECS Metadata Collector
2. ElasticSerach Metadata Cleaner
3. Kibana Emailer

The ECS Metadata Collector is responsible to collect metadata of various component stored in EMC Elastic Cloud Storage.  The collector polls remote ECS instances via REST API, and store results into an ElasticSearch cluster.

The ElasticSearch Cleaner is responsible to purge data that was collected > x number days. 
 
The Kibana emailer is responsible to generate email containing Kibana dashboards.  

##Target Deployment

###Assumptions:

1. 1 ECS Cluster with 4 ECS VMs
2. 3 ECS Analytics Hosts running Linux Centos 7
3. CPU 8 or more cores per host
4. 8G or more RAM per host
5. 10 GigE network between hosts
6. Enough storage to hold daily metadata. 2B objects scenario should require 550Gb per day per ElasticSearch node.

It is highly recommended to read ElasticSearch Node documentation to better understand the different roles an ElasticSearch Host can support.

[Elasticsearch Node Roles](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/modules-node.html#data-node)

As indicated in the Elasticsearch documentation see link, we recommend to install three master-eligible nodes with `minimum_master_nodes` set to 2.  In the future, extra data nodes can be added as required. 
  
	"An advantage of splitting the master and data roles between dedicated nodes is 
	that you can have just three master-eligible nodes and set minimum_master_nodes to 2.   
	You never have to change this setting, no matter how many dedicated data nodes you add 
	to the cluster."
	
#### Extra Assumptions

1. ECS collector program should be installed on all hosts.  It is expected that only one host is scheduled to collect from ECS hosts.
2. ECS cleaner program should be installed on all hosts. It is expected that only one host is scheduled to clean data from the ElasticSearch cluster
3. Kibana emailer works better on Ubuntu.  Issues were encountered tyring to use Centos6.   To be verified on Centos 7.
